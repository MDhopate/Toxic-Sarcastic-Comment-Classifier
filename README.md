# Toxic & Sarcastic Comment Classifier
The **Toxic & Sarcastic Comment Classifier** is a machine learning project aimed at identifying toxic and sarcastic comments in online conversations, such as those found in social media or forum discussions. The project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to accurately classify text, helping to moderate online interactions and foster safer communities.

## ‚≠ê Key Features  
- **Binary Classification:** Classifies text as either toxic or non-toxic, sarcastic or non-sarcastic.  
- **Multi-Label Prediction:** Capable of detecting multiple comment labels simultaneously (e.g., toxic and sarcastic).  
- **Preprocessing Pipeline:** Comprehensive text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization using NLP methods.  
- **Customizable Models:** Supports various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and advanced models like BERT).  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for performance evaluation.  
- **Interactive Testing:** Jupyter Notebook with interactive testing for user-provided comments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models)  
  - Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)  
  - NLTK, spaCy (text preprocessing)  
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)  
  - Jupyter Notebook  
- **Other Tools:**  
  - Flask (for potential deployment)  
  - SQL/NoSQL (for storing labeled data)  

## üöÄ Project Highlights  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Extensive preprocessing using techniques such as stopword removal, lemmatization, and word embedding (TF-IDF and Word2Vec).  
- **Model Training:** Experimented with multiple models including logistic regression, random forest, and neural networks, and fine-tuned a transformer-based model (BERT) for superior performance.  
- **Handling Class Imbalance:** Implemented strategies like oversampling and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to handle class imbalance.  
- **Cross-Validation:** Performed K-fold cross-validation to improve generalization and avoid overfitting.  
- **Confusion Matrix Analysis:** Detailed analysis of false positives and false negatives to optimize model thresholds.

## üå± Future Improvements  
- **Multi-Language Support:** Extend the classifier to handle comments in multiple languages.  
- **Contextual Understanding:** Integrate advanced contextual NLP models, such as GPT-based classifiers.  
- **Real-Time Deployment:** Deploy the classifier as a real-time service using Flask or a cloud platform (AWS/GCP).  
- **User Feedback Loop:** Implement a feedback loop mechanism to allow continuous improvement via user inputs.
